#### MVP

- Create red and yellow circle Task (Feburary 15-16 2025)
  - When mouse button is clicked, red or yellow circle will appear
- Add gravity into the game (Feburary 17-23 2025)
  - Mainly affecting the connect 4 circles, so when user click a specific area, the circle spawns in and have some sort of gravity when falling down or animation.
- Create the connect 4 game board (March 3-8 2025)
 - The ball goes into the board correctly and take turns<!--  -->
 - When someone wins, something pop up saying which color wins.
- Try and figure all the twist to add into connect 4 (Entire month of Match 2025)
  - The minigame will happen once the person decides to place their color chip, and it is decided if it gets place or not base on if you win the game or not.
  - Some examples are like flipping a coin, it you guess the correct side of the coin, you get to go, if not then you dont get to go
  - Winning a tic tac toe match, win = yes chip, lose = no chip, and tie = new game
  - Press a certain key on the keyboard in 2 second. You win = yes chip. no win = no chip
  - Solving a math problem.
- Spend the rest of the time of April to fix or spend more time on something I didn't finish
  - make sure I completed everything

- Some events like inverted color so players can't tell the colors.
  - random connect 4 pieces disappearing from the board
- Special abilities
  - Removing chips
